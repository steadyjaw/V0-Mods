## Printing

You need to print 3 parts:
- 1x display Mount
- 2x shortend Skirts

```
./STL/[a]_display_mount_x1.stl
./STL/skirt_front_left_x1.stl
./STL/skirt_front_right_x1.stl
```

## Assembly
 1. Mounting OLED to printed Part.
 2. Insert 2 BHCS M3 x6 to the display mount
 3. Use two `M2x10 Self Tapping Screws for Plastic` from BOM and snap like 6-7mm off of it. Fasten OLED with them.
 2. Remove old Skirt in the front
 3. Add two M3 nuts to the extrusion the skirts and the display mount will be mounted to
 4. Bolt 3 new parts to extrusion.
You'll need two erxtra M3 screws for that!
